Frustrated, degraded, down
before you're done
Rejection, depression,
can't get what you want

You ask me how I make my way
You ask me everywhere and why
You hang on every word I say
But the truth sounds like a lie

Live to win, 'till you die,
'till the light dies in your eyes
Live to win, take it all,
just keep fighting till you fall
