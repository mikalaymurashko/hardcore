Frustrated, degraded, down
before you're done
Rejection, depression,
can't get what you want

You ask me how I make my way
You ask me everywhere and why
You hang on every word I say
But the truth sounds like a lie

Live to win, 'till you die,
'till the light dies in your eyes
Live to win, take it all,
just keep fighting till you fall

Obsessive, compulsive, suffocate your mind
Confusion, delusions,
kill your dreams in time

You ask me how I took the pain
Crawled up from my lowest low
Step by step and day by day
'Till there's one last breath to go

Live to win, 'till you die,
'till the light dies in your eyes
Live to win, take it all,
just keep fighting till you fall

Day by day, kickin' all the way,
I'm not cavin' in
Let another round begin,
live to win
Yeah, live, yeah, win
